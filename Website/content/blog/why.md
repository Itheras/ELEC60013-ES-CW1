- Outstanding battery life and lightness
  - We do not rely on bulky and battery-intensive GPS devices; instead we use Apple’s FindMy Network, reserving battery power for only the on-device sensors. This allows us to increase battery life and make the collar even lighter, taking a literal load off your pet’s shoulders.
- Increased privacy
  - All of your data is transmitted over encrypted channels and stored securely using Google’s state-of-the-art services so you can sleep safe at night knowing that no one else can track your pet. Of course, Barkr keeps your data for only as long as its necessary and not a minute more, minimizing the chance of a privacy breach.
